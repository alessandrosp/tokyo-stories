    <p>Tokyo Stories is an attempt to describe the various districts of the Japanese capital, their history, landmarks, restaurants, museums, etc. Written by a coffee-lover, whisky-enthusiast, culture-oriented vegetarian hipster, this website doesn't want to offer a neutral point of view about Tokyo. On the contrary, this is a very personal collection of my favourte places in Tokyo organized by districts.</p>
