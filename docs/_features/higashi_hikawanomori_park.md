description: >
  Hikawanomori Park is a small green oasias in the heart of Higashi. Fairly well hidden, the park is mainly family-oriented, and it even features a sumo ring for kids. Adjacent to the park there's the Shibuya Hikawa-Jinja, a small Shinto shrine. Not meant for tourists, the park is a perfect place where to spend a few hours with the children.
