  Blue Bottle Coffee is a coffee roaster and retailer headquartered in Oakland, California. Created by in the early 2000s by a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic (their words), Blue Bottle is the quintessential hipster café. That said, their Aoyama shop is bright with sunlight, huge (185m²+) and a pleasure to hang out at. Aoyama Blue Bottle is located twelve kilometers from their Kiyosumi roastery, in a tucked-away alley, up a small flight of stairs.
