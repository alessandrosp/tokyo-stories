tldr:
  - Higashi is a calm and tranquil residencial area, perfectly located between Shibuya station and Ebisu station, and between Daikanyama station and Hirō station.
  - There are no reasons to visit Higashi as a turist. You're better off visiting the areas surrounding Shibuya stations. However, as a tourist, Higashi can be an excellent place to stay if you can find a temporary accomodation (there are no hotel in the area).
  - If you reside in Tokyo, Higashi can be a great neighborhood where to live. Whilst the district is pricey (as almost everywhere in Shibuka-ku), it's well-connected stations-wise and you can reach most of Shibuya on foot.
